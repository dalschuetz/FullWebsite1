        <h2>About the Vests</h2>
        <p>
          Foam clothing dramatically reduces moisture as being a threat to a
          person's life in the cold! Foam clothing is marketed to emergency
          preparedness and extreme sports audiences because of its ability to
          keep you warm in winter conditions. Being cold is one thing, but being
          cold and wet is miserable. Being cold, wet, and without shelter can be
          life threatening. This technology is usually sold in emergency
          preparedness venues and super expensive. It does make sense because
          the technology is super valuable that the clothing should cost a lot,
          but we disagree: nobody likes to be cold and people function a lot
          better when they are not freezing to death! So we created a foam vest
          that covers the core and we called the Turtle Shelter because it acts
          like a shelter and harnesses the wearer's body heat even while wet and
          even in freezing temperatures.

        <h2>How We Help</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is to ensure that every individual facing homelessness has
          access to essential warmth. Through community partnerships and
          generous donations, we distribute these life-saving vests where they
          are needed most.

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What are the vests made of?</h3>
        <p>
          The vests are made of foam insulation and a durable, wind-resistant
          outer layer to ensure maximum warmth and protection.

        <h3>I want to help, but I don’t sew.</h3>
        <p>
          Turtle Shelter Project vests are designed to be made by volunteers who
          have no special sewing skills. We can put any willing volunteer to
          work who can use a marker or a pair of scissors. Although we do need
          people with basic and advanced sewing skills, there are lots of the
          steps that can be done by those with no sewing skills. The final
          construction is done by our expert staff. The completed vests are then
          returned to the community where volunteers made them - or to another
          area with need.

        <h3>
          If you want to help homeless people be warm, why not just do a coat
          drive?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The foam insulation layer combined with moisture wicking fabrics
          creates a more effective insulation layer than other winter clothing.
          Clothing made from foam will provide warmth even if it is wet – it
          allows the wearer to maintain their core body temperature.
